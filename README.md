git join
----------------

A common git workflow involves maintaining three tiers of branch; transient feature branches, a development
version branch, and a release branch.

Feature branches are created for any new functionality you want to add to the next version of your program;
these are merged into development when they are finished, and then deleted.

The development branch holds the work-in-progress version of your program; you update it by merging in feature branches, and
occasionally committing directly to fix bugs.

The releases branch represents publically usable versions of your code. You never directly commit to this branch, but instead
you merge the development branch when your tests are green and you've finished adding features to this version.


```
                    A --- B --- C --- D       feat-Foo
                   /
o --- o --- o --- o                           development
       \
        o                                     releases
```

Git join makes merging feature branches easier; it merges the branch and then deletes it.

```
o --- o --- o --- o --- A --- B --- C --- D   development
       \
        o                                     releases
```
